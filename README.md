# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project contains the development of a real-time hand gesture recognition system created as part of the Machine Learning for Media Experiences course at Aalborg University Copenhagen. 

The goal of this project is to train an object detection model capable of recognizing a small set of static hand gestures and later integrate it into an interactive visualization.

The model will be designed and trained using the Edge Impulse Studio, and subsequently deployed in Python to power the visualization and interaction layer.
